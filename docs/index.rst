Welcome to barbeque's documentation!
====================================

Barbeque is a collection of custom extensions and helpers, mostly related to the Django Web framework.

These include a commands framework, logging helpers, django-anylink, filer extensions and much more.


Getting it
==========

You can get ``barbeque`` by using pip::

 $ pip install barbeque

If you want to install it from source, grab the git repository and run setup.py::

 $ git clone git://github.com/moccu/barbeque.git
 $ cd barbeque
 $ python setup.py install


Compatibility with versions of Python and Django
================================================

At this time we test and thrive to support valid combinations of Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and pypy with Django versions 1.8+. The most recent django master usually works too.
