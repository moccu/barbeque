Welcome to barbeque's documentation!
====================================

Barbeque is a collection of custom extensions and helpers, mostly related to the Django Web framework.

These include a commands framework, logging helpers, django-anylink, filer extensions and much more.


Getting it
==========

You can get ``barbeque`` by using pip::

 $ pip install barbeque

If you want to install it from source, grab the git repository and run setup.py::

 $ git clone git://github.com/moccu/barbeque.git
 $ cd barbeque
 $ python setup.py install


Compatibility with versions of Python and Django
=================================================

At this time we test and thrive to support valid combinations of Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.4 and pypy with Django versions 1.6 and 1.7. The most recent django master usually works too.
